# Request_For_Proposal-RFP-

Background: The Public Transit Authority (PTA) is examining the feasibility of building a new bus terminal in downtown Sydney, Nova Scotia. The bus terminal will have four bus bays, a heated waiting area with seating, a coffee shop and washrooms. There might also be underground parking for people who work in the area of Dorchester Street. The bus terminal may also be used by long-distance bus operators like Maritime Bus.

Research Problem: The PTA would like to commission a market research agency to conduct primary research among possible users of the services provided by the potential users of the bus terminal. Specifically, PTA would like to make decisions about the feasibility of the project, especially the financial aspects. Hence the crux of the project is to gain insights as to the number of people who will ride buses from and to the bus terminal and the amount that can be realized from underground parking. In addition, PTA would like to estimate the demand for the bus terminal, parking and coffee shop at various times of the day.

(i) Background that indicates your understanding of the project and the PTA.

(ii) Information that you will elicit from respondents
